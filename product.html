                <h2>Product 1: MITP</h2>
                <p><strong>MITP:</strong> MITIGAI Threat Intelligence Platform provides services that deliver regular alerts about threats specific to your organization, enabling necessary precautions. The platform empowers security analysts to investigate threats, vulnerabilities, and malicious URLs, logs, and scripts, seamlessly connects with EDRs, provides an intelligent IOA (Indicators of Attack) and IOC (Indicators of Compromise) classification system to reduce time spent on false positives, and a unique technique prediction engine tailored to your environment that predicts the most critical next techniques an incident can take, ensuring swift and effective responses to IOCs.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>MITIGAI URLGuard:</strong> Determines whether a URL is malicious or not by analyzing its content and history.</li>
                    <li><strong>MITIGAI CVEInsight:</strong> Provides detailed information about specific CVEs (Common Vulnerability Exposures), including severity scores and published dates.</li>
                    <li><strong>MITIGAI LogAnalyzer:</strong> Analyzes logs to identify suspicious network activities, spoofing attempts, and other potential threats.</li>
                    <li><strong>MITIGAI ScriptReverser:</strong> Interprets scripts and explains their purpose with a step-by-step breakdown for better debugging and analysis.</li>
                    <li><strong>MITIGAI EndpointGuard:</strong> Collects a wide range of information from endpoints to detect and respond to security threats in real-time.</li>
                    <li><strong>MITIGAI Technique Predictor:</strong> Predicts threat techniques and provides proactive measures to mitigate potential risks.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Product 2: MEMS</h2>
                <p>Vulnerability management can be quite challenging. Different scanning tools often have diverse focus areas, leading to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Focus Area Disparities:</strong> Tools specialize in different types of vulnerabilities, creating potential gaps in coverage if not used cohesively. Some tools specialize in infrastructure, while others focus on web applications, cloud environments, or endpoint security.</li>
                    <li><strong>Integration Challenges:</strong> Ensuring that various tools work seamlessly together can be difficult, often requiring custom solutions and additional overhead.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consolidation Efforts:</strong> Aggregating and consolidating the results from multiple tools can be labor-intensive and prone to errors, requiring significant manual intervention.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>MEMS [MITIGAI Exposure Management System]:</strong> Streamlines the vulnerability management process from detection to remediation by integrating with various vulnerability scanning tools, providing integrated dashboards, and remediation task flow.</p>

            <section class="product">
                <h2>Product 3: MICA-GDPR</h2>
                <p><strong>MICA GDPR</strong> is an AI-powered solution designed to assist organizations in evaluating their adherence to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements. It helps to streamline their GDPR compliance assessment process, reduce the risk of non-compliance penalties, and ensure that their data privacy practices meet the highest standards.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provides an automated and accurate assessment of an organization's GDPR compliance level.</li>
                    <li>Identifies specific areas within the company's data privacy policies or practices that require enhancements to meet GDPR standards.</li>
